Building sdr under Win95/WinNT

Because the tcl to C converter doesn't (currently) run under Windows,
there are two makefiles in this directory.  'Makefile' is used on
a unix system to convert tcl files to the corresponding C files then
make a tar of all the files needed to build sdr under windows.  (This
tar will be left in ../winsdr.tar)  Winsdr.tar should get moved to
a Windows system (using ftp, samba or whatever strikes your fancy)
and unpacked with winzip.  You should then be able to type
  nmake -f makefile.vc
to build sdr.

I have changed both makefiles so that they pick up the source file list from
src/Makefile.template and it is no longer necessary to modify them when
adding new source files. To use the unix Makefile you need to run gmake.

Remember to set the HOME and PATH enviroment variables to wherever you keep
your mbone tools before you run SDR on the PC. To do this add something
like the following to your autoexec.bat file:
	set HOME=C:\mbone
	set PATH= C:\WINDOWS; C:\WINDOWS\COMMAND; C:\mbone;
