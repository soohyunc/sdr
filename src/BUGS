<H1>SDR BUGS/UNFINISHED LIST</H1>

There are many little things on the to-do list.  The main big things are:
<PRE>
- end times of SIP sessions are bogus
- changing session type should reposition the session in the main window
  but doesn't.
- Two-way SIP sessions should be unicast not multicast.
- Only minimal SIP functionality implemented
- client/server split not yet finished
- built-in plugins can't be switched off
   - can (sort-of be overridden, but is ugly)
- sdr hangs in WWW browser during DNS lookup
- adding new admin scope zones should be automated
   + this is awaiting the client/server split
- doesn't handle SDPv2 repeat times with units "M" and "Y"
- repeat time offset lists are only handled in limited cases
- doesn't handle SDPv2 "i" fields in media
- internationalistion very patchy
- WWW browser should cache files
- Doesn't check the version field before updating entries - inefficient
- Doesn't do proper IPRA multicast address allocation
   + awaiting simulation results
- Doesn't cope properly with DNS names for multicast groups

<H2>Things which may still need looking at in SDR 2.9</H2>
<H3>A) General</H3><PRE>
1) Modify session doesn't work

2) Roy had problem:

  |  when changing the scope from admin to ttl:
  |    invalid command name ".new.f3.rr.f.r4"
  |     while executing
  | ".new.f3.rr.f.r4 invoke"
  |   ("default" arm line 3)

 Then when changing the ttl from 15 to world:

  |  can't read "win": no such variable
  |   while executing
  |  "$win.f3.rr.f.e configure -state normal"
  |  (procedure "disable_scope_entry" line 2)

 And when went back to admin scope - choose and configure media gave:

  |  can't read "fmtlayers(html..)": no such element in array
  |   while executing
  | "return $fmtlayers($media.$proto.$fmt)"

3) conflict with random and srandom prototypes
</PRE>
