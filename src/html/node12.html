<P>
When announcements are received, they are displayed in Sdr's main window.  Sdr has four modes which decide which of the currently advertised sessions are shown:
<UL><LI> All Session - all the sessions received are displayed.
<LI> Prefered Sessions - display all the sessions except those the user has stated they're not interested in.
<LI> Current Sessions - display only those sessions that are currently active (including those that are permanently active)
<LI> Future Sessions - display only those sessions that are not currently active.
</UL>
<P>
The default is <em> Prefered Sessions</em>, and the other options can be
selected from the Preferences window.  In this mode,
clicking the right mouse button on a session will hide the session.  A
menu is available from the Preferences menu which allows the user to
see all session, prefered or not, and select which are to be shown and
which are to be hidden.
<P>
Clicking the left mouse button on the name of a session in the Sdr main window will pop-up a window describing the session - an example is shown in figures <A HREF="help:node11">3</A> and <A HREF="help:node12">4</A>.  This lists a description of the session, when it is active, contact information for the creator of the session, and the media the session comprises.  Clicking on ``Start All&quot; will start all of the media tools necessary to join the session.  The media tools can also be started individually - this can be useful for restarting a tool that has failed, or for starting some tools on one machine and some on another as is common in a conference room scenario.
<P>
If the session was created by this user, then ``edit&quot; and ``delete&quot; options are also available.  A ``record&quot; option is also available, which will operate an interface to one of several session recording tools.  This recording interface is not yet implemented.
