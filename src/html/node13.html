<P>
Sdr provides a second way to view sessions in addition to their
display in the main window - selecting Calendar from the Sdr main
window pops up a calendar view of the current month and the next two
months (see figure <A HREF="help:node12">6</A>).  Days on which there are sessions scheduled
are highlighted in blue.  Clicking on a day on which there is a
session scheduled expands that day to show which sessions are planned
and what times they will be active (see figure <A HREF="help:node12">7</A>).  This allows
potential future clashes to be spotted and negotiation entered into
about suitable use of available bandwidth.
