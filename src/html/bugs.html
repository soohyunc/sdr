<H1>SDR BUGS/UNFINISHED LIST</H1>

There are many little things on the to-do list.  The main big things are:
<PRE><I>
- end times of SIP sessions are bogus
- changing session type should reposition the session in the main window
  but doesn't.
- Two-way SIP sessions should be unicast not multicast.
- Only minimal SIP functionality implemented
- client/server split not yet finished
- built-in plugins can't be switched off
   - can (sort-of be overridden, but is ugly)
- sdr hangs in WWW browser during DNS lookup
- adding new admin scope zones should be automated
   + this is awaiting the client/server split
- doesn't handle SDPv2 repeat times with units "M" and "Y"
- repeat time offset lists are only handled in limited cases
- doesn't handle SDPv2 "i" fields in media
- internationalistion very patchy
- WWW browser should cache files
- Doesn't check the version field before updating entries - inefficient
- Doesn't do proper IPRA multicast address allocation
   + awaiting simulation results
- Doesn't cope properly with DNS names for multicast groups
</pre>
