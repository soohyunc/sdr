<P>
If your session is not going to be active continuously between its start and stop times, then this detailed timing information should be provided so that users that wish to participate know the precise times, and users that do not wish to participate can know when to expect your traffic to be active.
<P>
Sdr  allows you to specify up to three active times or repeat intervals for your session - each active time or repeat interval specifies an addition set of times when the session will be active.  The limit of three is not imposed by the protocol - if sdr receives an announcement with more than  three repeat times it can decode and display it - but rather to simplify the user interface for session creation.
