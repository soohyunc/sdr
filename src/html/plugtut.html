<h1>Writing sdr plugins</h1>
Sdr plug-in configuration files follow a strict format of grouped
attribute:value pairs with one attribute value pair per line.  Leading
whitespace is ignored. Whitespace in the value part of an
attribute:value pair is significant. 

<h2>Compulsory fields</h2>

For a format or tool definition
file, the following attributes are compulsory and should be in the
following order:
<PRE>
  media:<I>media</I>
  proto:<I>protocol</I>
  tool:<I>tool-name</I>
</PRE>
See the SDP specification for definitions of <I>media</I> and
<I>protocol</I>.  <I>Tool-name</I> is the name of the tool you wish to
be started to send/receive this session.  
<H2>Optional header fields</h2>
<h3>protoname</h3>
As the protocol will often not be very meaning full to humans, these may be 
followed by further definition:
<PRE>
  protoname:<I>human readable versions of protocol</I>
</PRE>
Protoname is used at configure menus and labels on the user interface.
<h3>create</h3>
Most plugins define media and formats that you wish to be able to announce.
However, some may be just for backwards compatibility so you can receive
them but do not wish to announce them.  If this is the case, you can use
the <I>create</I> field to specify that you don't wish this plugin to contribute to the session creation menus and options:
<PRE>
  create:no
</PRE>

<h2>Format definitions</h2>

After these definitions should come one or more format definitions.
The minimal form of a format definition is:
<PRE>
  fmt:<I>format</I>
</PRE>
See the SDP specification for a more complete definition of what is meant
by a <I>format</I>.
<P>
More normally however a format definition will require additional configuration, and this can be done as follows:
<PRE>
  fmt:<I>format</I>
  {
      fmtname:<I>human readable version of format</I>
      flags:<I>command line flags for tool with this format</I>
  }
</PRE>

<h2>Media Attributes</h2>
Both media and session definitions can contain optional attributes.
These can be configured in the plugin on a per-tool or a per-format
basis.
<P>
Attributes can be of two types - either with a set of values, or just on/off.
<P>
On-off attributes can be configured as follows:
<PRE>
  attr:<I>attribute name</I>
  {
      attrname:<I>human readable version of attribute</I>
      flags:<I>command line flags for tool with this attribute</I>
  }
</PRE>
Attributes with a set of values can be configured as follows:
<PRE>
  attr:<I>attribute name</I>
  {
      attrname:<I>human readable version of attribute</I>
      attrvalue:<I>one possible value of attribute</I>
      {
         attrvaluename:<I>human readable version of this attribute vale</I>
         flags:<I>command line flags for tool with this attribute and value</I>
      }
      attrvalue:<I>another possible value of attribute</I>
      {
         attrvaluename:<I>human readable version of this attribute vale</I>
         flags:<I>command line flags for tool with this attribute and value</I>
      }
  }
</PRE>
Either type of attribute may be used within a format definition (if the attribute is format specific) or after all the format definitions are complete (if the attribute is independant of the format).
<P>
This mechanism assumes you can explicitly list all the values of an attribute.
Whilst this is often the case, it is not always so, and sdr plugins also allow the use of the <i>macro</i> and <i>value</i> definitions to allow flexible passing of attribute values directly to the media tool.  See below for more details.

<h3>noattr</h3>
Occasionally you want to specify a behaviour to apply when an attribute is <b>not</b> present.  To do this you use the <I>noattr</I> definition as follows:
<pre>
  noattr:<I>attribute name</I>
  {
      flags:<I>command line flags for tool if this attribute is missing</I>
  }
</pre>
A <I>noattr</I> definition must follow the equivalent <I>attr</i> definition.
<h2>Flags and Variables</h2>
The <i>flags</i> definition specifies a section of the command line that
will be used to start the media tool if this plugin is matched.  It can
be used in attribute and format definitions and also after all the definitions
are complete to finish the command line.  A simple example is:
<PRE>
  media:audio
  proto:RTP/AVP
  tool:rat
  fmt:pcm
  {
    flags:-f pcm
  }
  fmt:dvi
  {
    flags:-f dvi
  }
  flags:-t $(TTL)
  flags:$(ADDRESS)/$(PORT)
</PRE>
<P>
For an rtp session with pcm format audio on address 224.2.3.4 and port 3456
with ttl 1, this would start the rat tool as follows:
<PRE>
  rat -f pcm -t 1 224.2.3.4/3456
</PRE>
As can be seen above, <I>flags</I> definitions can include variables
that will be expanded when the session is started.  As complete list of
these variables is:
<UL>
<LI>$(ADDRESS)  - the address to send/recv to
<LI>$(PORT)  - the transport port to send/recv on
<LI>$(TTL)  - the ttl for multicast sessions
<LI>$(PROTO) - the value of the protocol field
<LI>$(FMT)  - the value of the format field
<LI>$(SESSNAME)  - the name of the session
<LI>$(CHAN)  - the channel number for LBL's conference bus
<LI>$(YOUREMAIL)  - the email address of the person running sdr
</UL>
<h2>Macros</h2>
In cases where the value of an attribute must be passed directly to the 
media tool, the above mechanisms are sometimes not sufficient.  To make
this mechanism more flexible, sdr plugins provide a very simple macro facility.
An example is:
<PRE>
media:audio
proto:vat
tool:vat
fmt:pcm
attr:id
{
  macro:ID
  {
    value:/$(VALUE)
  }
}
flags:$(ADDRESS)/$(PORT)$(ID)
</PRE>
In this case, the session attribute attribute "id" needs to be passed to vat at the end of the command line.  The special variable $(VALUE) is given the value of the "id" attribute, and this is substitutes in the string given in the "value" definition.  The resulting string is stored in the $(ID) variable, and expanded in the same way normal variables are when the tool is run.  If there is no "id" attribute in this particular session, then the $(ID) variable is set to the empty string.
<p>
For example, a session with address/port 224.5.6.7/5432 and no id field would be started as:
<pre>
vat 224.5.6.7/5432
</pre>
and a session with the id atribute 1234 would have $(ID) defined as "/1234" and would be started as:
<pre>
vat 224.5.6.7/5432/1234
</pre>
