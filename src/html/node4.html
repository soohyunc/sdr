<P>
A session announcement can contain an Uniform Resource Locator (URL) as a link to related information in the world wide web.  The preferences menu determines how sdr follows such references  - three options are supported:
<UL><LI>	Using the simple built in WWW browser
<LI>	Starting an external browser such as netscape or Mosaic
<LI>	Directing an already running external browser to the URL (Mosaic and netscape permit this sort of remote control operation).
</UL>
If you have an colour display of depth 8 bits, using the built in browser is recommended as external browsers use a significant number of the 256 available colours, leaving you with few colours remaining for any tools you wish to use in a multimedia conference.
If you have a 24bit display, external browsers are likely to provide you with better performance and prettier displays than the built-in browser.
When creating a session, it is recommended that the URL be tested (using the Test button) as typing mistakes here will make the URL useless.
