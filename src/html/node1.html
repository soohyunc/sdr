<P>
Sdr uses an announcement protocol called the Session Directory
Announcement Protocol.  In its simplest form, this involved
periodically multicasting a session announcement packet describing a
particular session.  To receive SDAP, a receiver simply listens on a
well known multicast address and port.  Sessions are described using the
Session Description Protocol (described below).  If a receiver
receives a session announcement packet it simply decodes the SDP
message, and then can display the session information for the user.
The interval between repeats of the same session description message
depends on the number of sessions being announced (each sender at a
particular scope can hear the other senders in the same scope) such
that the bandwidth being used for session announcements of a
particular scope is kept approximately constant.
<P>
If a receiver has been listening for a set time, and fails to hear a
session announcement, then the receiver can conclude that the session
has been deleted and no longer exists.  The set period is based on the
receivers estimate of how often the sender should be sending, and is
(arbitrarily) set to ten times the estimated send period.  It is
possible for network partitions to force inadvertent deletion of
sessions, but inadvertent deletion due to packet loss is extremely
unlikely.  In any event, such a deleted session will be reinstated as
soon as the network partition is resolved and another announcement
packet is received.
<P>
To allow relatively quick startup and display of long-lived sessions,
sdr keeps a local (per user) cache of sessions.  Upon startup, sdr
reads this cache, and displays those which have not yet reached their
expiry time.  This cache also holds sessions created by its owner, and
upon sdr startup, these sessions start to be re-announced.  Note that
with this simple model, a user must have a copy of sdr running for a
session created by that user to be announced and to not time-out at
receivers.
<P>
Extensions to SDAP not currently implemented involve allowing other
local copies of sdr to make proxy announcements of a session when its
originator is not announcing it.  Also other copies of sdr can serve
as cache servers, so that upon startup, a copy of sdr queries any
other locally running copies of sdr to update the entries in its local
cache.  This can be extended by having an sdr daemon running
continuously at a site and performing both the proxy announcement and
proxy receiver tasks - however the daemon is not essential for sdr to
be used - it simply provides an improvement is performance.
