<P>
Administrative Scope uses different ranges of multicast addresses to
constrain multicast traffic to a particular region.  To configure an
administrative scope zone, all the multicast routers bordering that
zone must be configured to be a boundary to that zone for a range of
multicast addresses.  Unlike TTL scope, if a conference is on a scoped
multicast address, traffic sources outside the scope zone will not be
able to inject traffic into the conference as administrative scope
zone boundaries are bi-directional.  A particular scope zone has a
range of multicast addresses, a default TTL, and a name.  Users of
administrative scope zones only need to know the zone name (e.g.
``United Kingdom'') to be able to scope their conference correctly -
the TTL and the address are allocated by sdr.
<P>
Currently there is no automatic way for sdr to learn about the
relevant scope zones - this must be configured on a per-site basis.
