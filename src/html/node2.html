<P>
The Session Description Protocol (SDP) is an ASCII text based protocol for
describing multimedia sessions and their related scheduling
information.  It was originally based on the protocol used by the <em>
sd</em> session directory from Lawrence Berkeley Labs, but has been
extended and generalised significantly since then.
<P>
The purpose of SDP is to convey information about media streams in
multimedia sessions to allow the recipients of a session description
to participate in the session.  SDP is primarily intended for use in a
internetwork, although it is sufficiently general that it can describe
conferences in other network environments.
<P>
A multimedia session, for these purposes, is defined as a set of media
streams that exist for a duration of time.  Media streams can be
many-to-many.  The times during which the session is active need not
be continuous.
<P>
Multicast based sessions on the internet differ from many other forms
of conferencing in that anyone receiving the traffic can join the
session (unless the session traffic is encrypted).  In such an
environment, SDP serves two primary purposes - as a means to
communicate the existence and timing of a session, and as a means to
convey sufficient information to enable joining and participating in
the session.  In a unicast environment, only the latter purpose is
likely to be relevant.
<P>
Thus the information SDP must convey includes:
<UL><LI> Name and purpose of session
<LI> Time(s) the session is active
<LI> The media comprising the session
<LI> Information to receive those media
</UL>
