<P>
Sdr has a simple built-in World Wide Web browser.  This is not
intended to be a full functioned browser because its main purpose is
to allow references to information about sessions to be checked and
browsed without starting up a fully functioned WWW browser which would
use a significant proportion of the available colour table entries on
most machines with 8 bit displays.  Thus Sdr's built in browser does
not display inline or background images - it merely displays the
formatted HTML text of a page with the hyperlinks to other pages
highlighted in blue.  Clicking on a blue link will take you to that
page.  Clicking on backward will take you back to the previous page,
and clicking on ``forward'' wil take you forward to the page you just
came backwards from.  A URL can be typed directly into the entry box
at the bottom of the window if required, and the browser will then go
directly to that page.  The World Wide Web is really beyond the scope
of this note - for more details see [<A HREF="help:node15">2</A>].
