<h2>What is the MBONE?</h2>

   The MBONE is an outgrowth of the first two IETF "audiocast"
    experiments in which live audio and video were multicast from the
    IETF meeting site to destinations around the world.  The idea is
    to construct a semi-permanent IP multicast testbed to carry the
    IETF transmissions and support continued experimentation between
    meetings.  This is a cooperative, volunteer effort.
<p>
    The MBONE is a virtual network.  It is layered on top of portions
    of the physical Internet to support routing of IP multicast
    packets since that function has not yet been integrated into many
    production routers.  The network is composed of islands that can
    directly support IP multicast, such as multicast LANs like
    Ethernet, linked by virtual point-to-point links called "tunnels".
    The tunnel endpoints are typically workstation-class machines
    having operating system support for IP multicast and running the
    "mrouted" multicast routing daemon.

<h2>How do IP multicast tunnels work?</h2>

    IP multicast packets are encapsulated for transmission through
    tunnels, so that they look like normal unicast datagrams to
    intervening routers and subnets.  A multicast router that wants to
    send a multicast packet across a tunnel will prepend another IP
    header, set the destination address in the new header to be the
    unicast address of the multicast router at the other end of the
    tunnel, and set the IP protocol field in the new header to be 4
    (which means the next protocol is IP).  The multicast router at
    the other end of the tunnel receives the packet, strips off the
    encapsulating IP header, and forwards the packet as appropriate.
<p>
    Previous versions of the IP multicast software (before March 1993)
    used a different method of encapsulation based on an IP Loose
    Source and Record Route option.  This method remains an option in
    the new software for backward compatibility with nodes that have
    not been upgraded.  In this mode, the multicast router modifies
    the packet by appending an IP LSRR option to the packet's IP
    header.  The multicast destination address is moved into the
    source route, and the unicast address of the router at the far end
    of the tunnel is placed in the IP Destination Address field.  The
    presence of IP options, including LSRR, may cause modern router
    hardware to divert the tunnel packets through a slower software
    processing path, causing poor performance.  Therefore, use of the
    new software and the IP encapsulation method is strongly
    encouraged.

<h2>What is the topology of the MBONE?</h2>

    We anticipate that within a continent, the MBONE topology will be
    a combination of mesh and star: the backbone and regional (or
    mid-level) networks will be linked by a mesh of tunnels among
    mrouted machines located primarily at interconnection points of
    the backbones and regionals.  Some redundant tunnels may be
    configured with higher metrics for robustness.  Then each regional
    network will have a star hierarchy hanging off its node of the
    mesh to fan out and connect to all the customer networks that want
    to participate.
<p>
    Between continents there will probably be only one or two tunnels,
    preferably terminating at the closest point on the MBONE mesh.  In
    the US, this may be on the Ethernets at the two FIXes (Federal
    Internet eXchanges) in California and Maryland.  But since the
    FIXes are fairly busy, it will be important to minimize the number
    of tunnels that cross them.  This may be accomplished using IP
    multicast directly (rather than tunnels) to connect several
    multicast routers on the FIX Ethernet.

<h2>How is the MBONE topology going to be set up and coordinated?</h2>

    The primary reason we set up the MBONE e-mail lists (see below)
    was to coordinate the top levels of the topology (the mesh of
    links among the backbones and regionals).  This must be a
    cooperative project combining knowledge distributed among the
    participants, somewhat like Usenet.  The goal is to avoid loading
    any one individual with the responsibility of designing and
    managing the whole topology, though perhaps it will be necessary
    to periodically review the topology to see if corrections are
    required.
<p>
    The intent is that when a new regional network wants to join in,
    they will make a request on the appropriate MBONE list, then the
    participants at "close" nodes will answer and cooperate in setting
    up the ends of the appropriate tunnels.  To keep fanout down,
    sometimes this will mean breaking an existing tunnel to inserting
    a new node, so three sites will have to work together to set up
    the tunnels.
<p>
    To know which nodes are "close" will require knowledge of both the
    MBONE logical map and the underlying physical network topology,
    for example, the physical T3 NSFnet backbone topology map combined
    with the network providers' own knowledge of their local topology.
<p>
    Within a regional network, the network's own staff can
    independently manage the tunnel fanout hierarchy in conjunction
    with end-user participants.  New end-user networks should contact
    the network provider directly, rather than the MBONE list, to get
    connected.

<h2>What is the anticipated traffic level?</h2>

    The traffic anticipated during IETF multicasts is 100-300Kb/s, so
    500Kb/s seems like a reasonable design bandwidth.  Between IETF
    meetings, most of the time there will probably be no audio or
    video traffic, though some of the background session/control
    traffic may be present.  A guess at the peak level of experimental
    use might be 5 simultaneous voice conversations (64Kb/s each).
    Clearly, with enough simultaneous conversations, we could exceed
    any bandwidth number, but 500Kb/s seems reasonable for planning.
<p>
    Note that the design bandwidth must be multiplied by the number of
    tunnels passing over any given link since each tunnel carries a
    separate copy of each packet.  This is why the fanout of each
    mrouted node should be no more than 5-10 and the topology should
    be designed so that at most 1 or 2 tunnels flow over any T1 line.
<p>
    While most MBONE nodes should connect with lines of at least T1
    speed, it will be possible to carry restricted traffic over slower
    speed lines.  Each tunnel has an associated threshold against
    which the packet's IP time-to-live (TTL) value is compared.  By
    convention in the IETF multicasts, higher bandwidth sources such
    as video transmit with a smaller TTL so they can be blocked while
    lower bandwidth sources such as compressed audio are allowed
    through.

<h2>Why should I (a network provider) participate?</h2>

    To allow your customers to participate in IETF audiocasts and
    other experiments in packet audio/video, and to gain experience
    with IP multicasting for a relatively low cost.

<h2>What technical facilities and equipment are required for a network
  provider to join the MBONE?</h2>

    Each network-provider participant in the MBONE provides one or
    more IP multicast routers to connect with tunnels to other
    participants and to customers.  The multicast routers are
    typically separate from a network's production routers since most
    production routers don't yet support IP multicast.  Most sites use
    workstations running the mrouted program, but the experimental
    MOSPF software for Proteon routers is an alternative (see MOSPF
    question below).
<p>
    It is best if the workstations can be dedicated to the multicast
    routing function to avoid interference from other activities and
    so there will be no qualms about installing kernel patches or new
    code releases on short notice.  Since most MBONE nodes other than
    endpoints will have at least three tunnels, and each tunnel
    carries a separate (unicast) copy of each packet, it is also
    useful, though not required, to have multiple network interfaces
    on the workstation so it can be installed parallel to the unicast
    router for those sites with configurations like this:
<pre>
		   +----------+
		   | Backbone |
		   |   Node   |
		   +----------+
			|
    ------------------------------------------ External DMZ Ethernet
	     |               |
	+----------+    +----------+
	|  Router  |    |  mrouted |
	+----------+    +----------+
	     |               |
    ------------------------------------------ Internal DMZ Ethernet
</pre><p>
    (The "DMZ" Ethernets borrow that military term to describe their
    role as interface points between networks and machines controlled
    by different entities.)  This configuration allows the mrouted
    machine to connect with tunnels to other regional networks over
    the external DMZ and the physical backbone network, and connect
    with tunnels to the lower-level mrouted machines over the internal
    DMZ, thereby splitting the load of the replicated packets.  (The
    mrouted machine would not do any unicast forwarding.)
<p>
    Note that end-user sites may participate with as little as one
    workstation that runs the packet audio and video software and has
    a tunnel to a network-provider node.

<h2>What skills are needed to participate and how much time might have
  to be devoted to this?</h2>

    The person supporting a network's participation in the MBONE
    should have the skills of a network engineer, but a fairly small
    percentage of that person's time should be required.  Activities
    requiring this skill level would be choosing a topology for
    multicast distribution with in the provider's network and
    analyzing traffic flow when performance problems are identified.
<p>
    To set up and run an mrouted machine will require the knowledge to
    build and install operating system kernels.  If you would like to
    use a hardware platform other than those currently supported, then
    you might also contribute some software implementation skills!
<p>
    We will depend on participants to read mail on the appropriate
    mbone mailing list and respond to requests from new networks that
    want to join and are "nearby" to coordinate the installation of
    new tunnel links.  Similarly, when customers of the network
    provider make requests for their campus nets or end systems to be
    connected to the MBONE, new tunnel links will need to be added
    from the network provider's multicast routers to the end systems
    (unless the whole network runs MOSPF).
<p>
    Part of the resources that should be committed to participate
    would be for operations staff to be aware of the role of the
    multicast routers and the nature of multicast traffic, and to be
    prepared to disable multicast forwarding if excessive traffic is
    found to be causing trouble.  The potential problem is that any
    site hooked into the MBONE could transmit packets that cover the
    whole MBONE, so if it became popular as a "chat line", all
    available bandwidth could be consumed.  Steve Deering plans to
    implement multicast route pruning so that packets only flow over
    those links necessary to reach active receivers; this will reduce
    the traffic level.  This problem should be manageable through the
    same measures we already depend upon for stable operation of the
    Internet, but MBONE participants should be aware of it.

<h2>Which workstation platforms can support the mrouted program?</h2>

    The most convenient platform is a Sun SPARCstation simply because
    that is the machine used for mrouted development.  An older
    machine (such as a SPARC-1 or IPC) will provide satisfactory
    performance as long as the tunnel fanout is kept in the 5-10
    range.  The platforms for which software is available:
<pre>
    Machines             Operating Systems       Network Interfaces
    --------             -----------------       ------------------
    Sun SPARC            SunOS 4.1.1,2,3         ie, le, lo
    Vax or Microvax      4.3+ or 4.3-tahoe       de, qe, lo
    Decstation 3100,5000 Ultrix 3.1c, 4.1, 4.2a  ln, se, lo
    Silicon Graphics     All ship with multicast
</pre>
    There is an interested group at DEC that may get the software
    running on newer DEC systems with Ultrix and OSF/1.  Also, some
    people have asked about support for the RS-6000 and AIX or other
    platforms.  Those interested could use the mbone list to coordinate
    collaboration on porting the software to these platforms!
<p>
    An alternative to running mrouted is to run the experimental MOSPF
    software in a Proteon router (see MOSPF question below).

<h2>Where can I get the IP multicast software and mrouted program?</h2>

    The IP multicast software is available by anonymous FTP from the
    vmtp-ip directory on host gregorio.stanford.edu.  Here's a
    snapshot of the files:
<pre>
	ipmulti-pmax31c.tar
	ipmulti-sunos41x.tar.Z	    Binaries & patches for SunOS 4.1.1,2,3
	ipmulticast-ultrix4.1.patch
	ipmulticast-ultrix4.2a-binary.tar
	ipmulticast-ultrix4.2a.patch
	ipmulticast.README	    [** Warning: out of date **]
	ipmulticast.tar.Z	    Sources for BSD

### Release 3.3 of the SunOS kernel multicast extensions was made in
### late August, but was not put on gregorio like previous releases.
### Instead, it is on parcftp.xerox.com, directory pub/net-research,
### file ipmulti3.3-sunos413x.tar.Z  This release has multicast
### pruning and several other major improvements over previous
### releases, so upgrading is encouraged.
</pre>
    You don't need kernel sources to add multicast support.  Included
    in the distributions are files (sources or binaries, depending
    upon the system) to modify your BSD, SunOS, or Ultrix kernel to
    support IP multicast, including the mrouted program and special
    multicast versions of ping and netstat.
<p>
    Silicon Graphics includes IP multicast as a standard part of their
    operating system.  The mrouted executable and ip_mroute kernel
    module are not installed by default; you must install the
    eoe2.sw.ipgate subsystem and "autoconfig" the kernel to be able to
    act as a multicast router.  In the IRIX 4.0.x release, there is a
    bug in the kernel code that handles multicast tunnels; an
    unsupported fix is available via anonymous ftp from sgi.com in the
    sgi/ipmcast directory.  See the README there for details on
    installing it.
<p>
    IP multicast is also included in all Solaris 2 releases.  Solaris
    2.3 out of the box supports the non-pruning version of mrouted
    (mrouted version 2.0-2.2), but mrouted is not included with
    Solaris so you must fetch the mrouted sources from the multicast
    software distribution and compile them.  Solaris 2.2 requires
    patches to run mrouted, available from ftp.uoregon.edu in the
    directory /pub/Solaris2.x/src/MBONE/Solaris2.x/Kernel.
<p>
    IP multicast is supported in BSD 4.4.
<p>
    The most common problem encountered when running this software is
    with hosts that respond incorrectly to IP multicasts.  These
    responses typically take the form of ICMP network unreachable,
    redirect, or time-exceeded error messages, which are a waste of
    bandwidth and can cause an error in the packet send operation
    executed by a multicast source.  The result may be dropouts in an
    audio or video stream.  These responses are in violation of the
    current IP specification and, with luck, will disappear over time.

<h2>What documentation is available?</h2>

    Documentation on the IP multicast software is included in the
    distribution on gregorio.stanford.edu (ipmulticast.README).
    RFC1112 specifies the "Host Extensions for IP Multicasting".
<p>
    Multicast routing algorithms are described in the paper "Multicast
    Routing in Internetworks and Extended LANs" by S. Deering, in the
    Proceedings of the ACM SIGCOMM '88 Conference.
<p>
    There is an article in the June 1992 ConneXions about the first
    IETF audiocast from San Diego, and a later version of that article
    is in the July 1992 ACM SIGCOMM CCR.  A reprint of the latter
    article is available by anonymous FTP from venera.isi.edu in the
    file pub/ietf-audiocast-article.ps.  There is no article yet about
    later IETF audio/videocasts.

<h2>Where can I get a map of the MBONE?</h2>

    The most recent "complete" map of the MBONE is available in two
    Postscript files are available on parcftp.xerox.com: 
<pre>
        /pub/net-research/mbone-map-{big,small}.ps
</pre>
    The small one fits on one page but is hard to read, and the big
    one is four pages that have to be taped together for viewing.
    This map was produced from topology information collected
    automatically from all MBONE nodes that respond to remote queries
    for mapping information (some are running ancient versions of
    mrouted that do not respond, and some are hidden by firewalls or
    routing boundaries).  Pavel Curtis at Xerox PARC has added the
    mechanisms to automatically collect the map data and produce the
    map.  (Thanks also to Paul Zawada of NCSA who manually produced an
    earlier map of the MBONE.)
<p>
    The MBONE is now large enough that it is hard to show all nodes
    and links on one graph.  To give a higher level view of the MBONE,
    there is another map that shows only the major links and nodes in
    a roughly geographical representation that was created manually by
    Steve Casner.  It is available from ftp.isi.edu:
<pre>
	mbone/mbone-topology.ps
</pre>
<h2>What is DVMRP?</h2>

    DVMRP is the Distance Vector Multicast Routing Protocol; it is the
    routing protocol implemented by the mrouted program.  An earlier
    version of DVMRP is specified in RFC-1075.  However, the version
    implemented in mrouted is quite a bit different from what is
    specified in that RFC (different packet format, different tunnel
    format, additional packet types, and more).  It maintains
    topological knowledge via a distance-vector routing protocol (like
    RIP, described in RFC-1058), upon which it implements a multicast
    forwarding algorithm called Truncated Reverse Path Broadcasting.
    DVMRP suffers from the well-known scaling problems of any
    distance-vector routing protocol.

<h2>What is MOSPF?</h2>

    MOSPF is the IP multicast extension to the OSPF routing protocol,
    currently an Internet Draft.  John Moy has implemented MOSPF for
    the Proteon router.  A network of routers running MOSPF can
    forward IP multicast packets directly, sending no more than one
    copy over any link, and without the need for any tunnels.  This is
    how IP multicasting within a domain is supposed to work.

<h2>Can MOSPF and DVMRP interoperate?</h2>

    At the Boston IETF, John Moy agreed to add support for DVMRP to his
    MOSPF implementation.  He hopes to have this completed "well in
    advance of the next IETF".  When it is finished, you will be able
    to set up a DVMRP tunnel from an mrouted to Proteon a router,
    glueing together the DVMRP with MOSPF domains (the MOSPF domains
    will look pretty like ethernets to the multicast topology).
<p>
    The advantages to linking DVMRP with MOSPF are: fewer configured
    tunnels, and less multicast traffic on the links inside the MOSPF
    domain.  There are also a couple potential drawbacks: increasing
    the size of DVMRP routing messages, and increasing the number of
    external routes in the OSPF systems.  However, it should be
    possible to alleviated these drawbacks by configuring area address
    ranges and by judicious use of MOSPF default routing.

<h2>How do I join the MBONE?</h2>

    STEP 1: If you are an end-user site (e.g., a campus), please
    contact your network provider.  If your network provider is not
    participating in the MBONE, you can arrange to connect to some
    nearby point that is on the MBONE, but it is far better to
    encourage your network provider to participate to avoid
    overloading links with duplicate tunnels to separate end nodes.
    Below is a list of some network providers who are participating in
    the MBONE, but this list is likely not to be complete.
<pre>

</pre>
    If you are a network povider, send a message to the -request
    address of the mailing list for your country to be added to that
    list for purposes of coordinating setup of tunnels, etc:
<pre>
	Australia:	mbone-oz-request@internode.com.au

    If your country is not listed, send your request to the appropriate

<pre>
	Europe:		mbone-eu-request@sics.se
	N. America:	mbone-na-request@isi.edu
	other:		mbone-request@isi.edu
</pre>
    These lists are primarily aimed at network providers who would be
    the top level of the MBONE organizational and topological
    hierarchy.  The mailing list is also a hierarchy; mbone@isi.edu
    forwards to the regional lists, then those lists include expanders
    for network providers and other institutions.  Mail of general
    interest should be sent to mbone@isi.edu, while regional topology
    questions should be sent to the appropriate regional list.
<p>
    Individual networks may also want to set up their own lists for
    their customers to request connection of campus mrouted machines
    to the network's mrouted machines.  Some that have done so were
    listed above.
<p>
    STEP 2: Set up an mrouted machine, build a kernel with IP
    multicast extensions added, and install the kernel and mrouted;
    or, install MOSPF software in a Proteon router.
<p>
    STEP 3: Send a message to the mbone list for your region asking to
    hook in, then coordinate with existing nodes to join the tunnel
    topology.

<h2>How is a tunnel configured?</h2>

    Mrouted automatically configures itself to forward on all
    multicast-capable interfaces, i.e. interfaces that have the
    IFF_MULTICAST flag set (excluding the loopback "interface"), and
    it finds other mrouteds directly reachable via those interfaces.
    To override the default configuration, or to add tunnel links to
    other mrouteds, configuration commands may be placed in
    /etc/mrouted.conf.  There are two types of configuration command:
<pre>
        phyint <local-addr>   [disable]   [metric <m>] [threshold <t>]

        tunnel <local-addr> <remote-addr> [metric <m>] [threshold <t>]
</pre>
    The phyint command can be used to disable multicast routing on the
    physical interface identified by local IP address <local-addr>, or
    to associate a non-default metric or threshold with the specified
    physical interface.  Phyint commands should precede tunnel
    commands.
<p>
    The tunnel command can be used to establish a tunnel link between
    local IP address <local-addr> and remote IP address <remote-addr>,
    and to associate a non-default metric or threshold with that
    tunnel.  The tunnel must be set up in the mrouted.conf files of
    both ends before it will be used.  The keyword "srcrt" can be
    added just before the keyword "metric" to choose source routing
    for the tunnel if necessary because the other end has not yet
    upgraded to use IP encapsulation.  Upgrading is highly encouraged.
    If the methods don't match at the two ends, the tunnel will appear
    to be up according to mrouted typeouts, but no multicast packets
    will flow.
<p>
    The metric is the "cost" associated with sending a datagram on the
    given interface or tunnel; it may be used to influence the choice
    of routes.  The metric defaults to 1.  Metrics should be kept as
    small as possible, because mrouted cannot route along paths with a
    sum of metrics greater than 31.  It is recommended that the metric
    of all links be set to 1 unless you are specifically trying to
    force traffic to take another path.  On such a "backup tunnel",
    the metric should be the sum of metrics on primary path + 1.
<p>
    The threshold is the minimum IP time-to-live required for a
    multicast datagram to be forwarded to the given interface or
    tunnel.  It is used to control the scope of multicast datagrams.
    (The TTL of forwarded packets is only compared to the threshold,
    it is not decremented by the threshold.  Every multicast router
    decrements the TTL by 1.)  The default threshold is 1.
<p>
    Since the multicast routing protocol implemented by mrouted does
    not yet prune the multicast delivery trees based on group
    membership (it does something called "truncated broadcast", in
    which it prunes only the leaf subnets off the broadcast trees), we
    instead use a kludge known as "TTL thresholds" to prevent
    multicasts from traveling along unwanted branches.  This is NOT
    the way IP multicast is supposed to work; MOSPF does it right, and
    mrouted will do it right some day.
<p>
    Before the November 1992 IETF we established the following
    thresholds.  The "TTL" column specifies the originating IP
    time-to-live value to be used by each application.  The "thresh"
    column specifies the mrouted threshold required to permit passage
    of packets from the corresponding application, as well as packets
    from all applications above it in the table:
<pre>						TTL     thresh
						---     ------
	IETF chan 1 low-rate GSM audio		255	 224
	IETF chan 2 low-rate GSM audio		223	 192
	IETF chan 1 PCM audio			191	 160
	IETF chan 2 PCM audio			159	 128
	IETF chan 1 video			127	  96
	IETF chan 2 video			 95	  64
	local event audio			 63	  32
	local event video			 31	   1
</pre>
    It is suggested that a threshold of 128 be used initially, and
    then raise it to 160 or 192 only if the 64 Kb/s voice is excessive
    (GSM voice is about 18 Kb/s), or lower it to 64 to allow video to
    be transmitted to the tunnel.
<p>
    Mrouted will not initiate execution if it has fewer than two
    enabled vifs, where a vif (virtual interface) is either a physical
    multicast-capable interface or a tunnel.  It will log a warning if
    all of its vifs are tunnels, based on the reasoning that such an
    mrouted configuration would be better replaced by more direct
    tunnels (i.e., eliminate the middle man).  However, to create a
    hierarchical fanout for the MBONE, we will have mrouted
    configurations that consist only of tunnels.
<p>
    Once you have edited the mrouted.conf file, you must run mrouted
    as root.  See ipmulticast.README for more information.

<h2>Have there been any movements towards productizing any of this?</h2>

    The network infrastructure will require resource management
    mechanisms to provide low delay service to real-time applications
    on any significant scale.  That will take a few years.  Until that
    time, product-level robustness won't be possible.  However,
    vendors are certainly interested in these applications, and
    products may be targeted initially to LAN operation.
<p>
    IP multicast host extensions are being added to some vendors'
    operating systems.  That's one of the first steps.  Proteon has
    announced IP multicast support in their routers.  No network
    provider is offering production IP multicast service yet.
