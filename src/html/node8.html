<P>
TTL Scope is constrained by the ``Time To Live&quot; (TTL) field in the IP
packets a multicast application sends.  An application sends its data
with a fixed TTL.  Each multicast router that the data traverses
decreases the TTL on the packets by one.  Each multicast router also
has a threshold associated with each multicast capable interface or multicast
tunnel.  If the TTL on the data packets arriving at a router is lower
that the threshold of the interface or tunnel, then the packet is not
forwarded out of that interface.
<P>
The multicast tunnels comprising the Mbone are configured so that it
is possible to constrain a conference to a particular region of the
Mbone by careful setting of the TTL.  Thus the multicast tunnels in
Europe are generally configured with the following thresholds:
<UL><LI>	Low Speed Tunnels: 128
<LI>	Intercontinental: 64
<LI>	International (within Europe): 48
<LI>	Between institutions: 16-32 depending on the links involved
<LI>	Within an institution: 1-16
</UL>
Thus if I'm sending from the UK, and want my traffic to reach Europe only, I would send with a TTL of 63, which would traverse the international tunnels but not the intercontinental ones.
