<h1>Sdr Plug-In Modules</h1>

<body>
Sdr can be configured to support new tools by means of plug-in modules
which define the media, protocol and formats supported by a tool,
along with long-form names for these formats and the flags that are
needed to start up the tool.
<P>
Sdr will read files in "/usr/local/etc/sdr/plugins" and
"~/.sdr/plugins" and will search for files whose name begins
"sdr2.plugin.".  The naming convention for plugins is
"sdr2.plugin.<I>sequence.media.protocol.format.tool</I>" where for
convenience, <I>format</I> is often wildcarded when the plugin file
contains many formats.
<P>
New media can also defined in this manner but this should not be done 
without prior discussion on the mailing list "remconf@es.net" to avoid
undesirable proliferation of media definitions for what really should be
protocols or formats.
<P>
Sdr has built in definitions for the following:

<LI>audio rtp lpc vat
<LI>audio vat pcm vat
<LI>audio vat dvi vat

<LI>video rtp nv vic
<LI>video rtp jpeg vic
<LI>video rtp cellB vic
<LI>video rtp nv nv
<LI>whiteboard udp wb wb

If you wish to add new protocols,formats or tools you'll need to
create an appropriate sdr plugin and distribute it to anyone you wish
to participate in your session.
